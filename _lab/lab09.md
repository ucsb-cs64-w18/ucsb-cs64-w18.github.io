<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  While this assignment is included along with the labs, this is only because it is expected to be completed during the last week, as with a typical lab.
  Instead of being graded as a lab assignment, this counts towards overall 5% of your grade on the final exam.
  This grade is split up into two non-equal parts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Task 1: 3% of the Final Exam</li>
  <li>Task 2: 2% of the Final Exam</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that unlike with the labs, <b>this is an individual assignment</b>.
  That is, you may <b>not</b> work with a partner for this assignment.
</p>

<h2>Assignment Background</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of this assignment is to expose you to CS in wider society, relating both to ethical questions and recent impacts.
  While this information is not directly related the stated content of CS64 per se, it is still quite relevant and nonetheless important.
  You have reached a point in your student careers where you have been exposed to a wealth of information central to CS, but not much information concerning the broader impact and scope of this CS information.
  This assignment is intended to expose you to some of this larger context.
</p>

<h2>Assignment Goals</h2>
<p>By the time you have completed this work, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand clauses from the ACM/IEEE-CS code of ethics, and which clauses apply in various scenarios</li>
  <li>Identify recent impacts of computer science in the surrounding world</li>
</ul>
  
<hr>
<h2>Step by Step Instructions</h2>
<p>
  This assignment is split into two distinct tasks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Task 1: Identify Relevant Code of Ethics Clauses</li>
  <li>Task 2: Identify the Global Impacts of Computer Science in Assorted Domains</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="ethics">Task 1: Identify Relevant Code of Ethics Clauses</a></h2>
<p>
  Read the joint ACM/IEEE-CS code of ethics <a href="https://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/Publications/code-of-ethics.pdf">here</a>.
  After you have familiarized yourself with the code of ethics, read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nei10LeZYF3xnzHwek7CKJUNbAG_YiYV2RjDAj-R3bI">these case studies on ethics</a>.
  From there, go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_J2yJi0rreFNcEhYeVDLlmlJulvmd28_J4q7OiYvVl8/viewform">this form</a>, where you will identify which clauses from the code of ethics are more relevant to each case study.
