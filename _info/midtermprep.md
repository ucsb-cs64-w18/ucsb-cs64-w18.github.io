<h1>Midterm Exam Review</h1>
<p>
  The exam will consist of multiple-choice, short-answer questions and writing your own code. You will need to prepare by reviewing the lectures numbered 1 through 9 and the requisite readings. In addition, you should also review all the labs we have done (1, 2, and 3). 
</p>
<p>
For the labs, this includes <b>both</b> code you've written and questions you've answered.
Between this review and the labs, this information is intended to be comprehensive; there will be no material on the exam which isn't touched by either the labs or this review.
